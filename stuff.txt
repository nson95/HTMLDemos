Greetings my name is Nick Sonnenberg. I am currently enrolled in MAX Technical Training coding career bootcamp.
Before starting the bootcamp I was a computer repair technician. My experience added to my full stack software development training 
and makes me feel excited about my new career. My favorite part of bootcamp is the comraderie with my fellow students
and being around so many people that are focused on personal growth. Stay tuned and continue to follow my growth through bootcamp
